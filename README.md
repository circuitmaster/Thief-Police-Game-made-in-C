I have made this game at c programming course of my University. It is a 2d terminal/console based game.

-Purpose of game is reaching exit without getting caught by policeman.

-There are two difficulty options which are easy and hard: at first one policeman moves randomly where at second he moves towards you (according to manhattan distance).
